Photography Site for Hannah Winsted

Goal is to create a site for customers to view portfolio, pricing, and contact info.

Future Changes:
- Contact Request Form
- Slideshow integration for archives
- Combine all css files into one main file
- Archive management via cloud file managment (ability to change featured archive images without changing actual html/css files)
	- spreadsheet: title, description, image location // need to learn jscript first
- Add test for mobile browser support
