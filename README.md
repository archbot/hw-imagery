Photography Site for Hannah Winsted

Goal is to create a site for customers to view portfolio, pricing, and contact info.

Immediate Changes:
- Change links to hw-imagery.ueuo...
- Clean up repos (delete, merge, re-upload, etc)
- Final run-through (finalize slideshow & archive images, verify pricing)

Future Changes:
- Contact Request Form
- Create Facebook Page
- Add info to business search sites (yelp, google, etc)
- Slideshow integration for archives
- Combine all css files into one main file
- Archive management via cloud file managment (ability to change featured archive images without changing actual html/css files)
	- spreadsheet: title, description, image location // need to learn jscript first
- Add test for mobile browser support
