Photography Site for Hannah Winsted

Goal is to create a site for customers to view portfolio, pricing, and contact info.

Immediate Changes:
- Final run-through (finalize slideshow & archive images, verify pricing)

Future Changes:
- Create Facebook Page
- Add info to business search sites (yelp, google, etc)
- *Slideshow integration for archives
- Combine all css files into one main file
- Archive management via cloud file managment (ability to change featured archive images without changing actual html/css files)
	- spreadsheet: title, description, image location // need to learn jscript first
- Add test for mobile browser support

*Archive Page will be 3colx6row. Click archive brings you to new page with gallery of images. Click image opens slideshow plugin with option to close or cycle through images.

Completed:
- Basic slideshow for landing page
- Archive page structure set up
- Contact Request form

Version 0.5
Completely functional site without all images files uploaded/organized. Contact form is functional, navigation working properly. May still contain minor bugs, CSS files need cleaned and ideally merged, waiting on final images from Hannah for slideshow/archives.
