Photography Site for Hannah Winsted

This is the first site I ever created. It was the first iteration of <a href="HannahWPhotography.com">HannahWPhotography.com</a> which has evolved greatly since this was made.

Goal is to create a site for customers to view portfolio, pricing, and contact info.

Version 0.7
All pages are live, including archive galleries and contact page. Need to finalize pricing, add social media links to contact page, optimize for mobile, and condense & clean code.

Version 0.5
Completely functional site without all images files uploaded/organized. Contact form is functional, navigation working properly. May still contain minor bugs, CSS files need cleaned and ideally merged, waiting on final images from Hannah for slideshow/archives.
