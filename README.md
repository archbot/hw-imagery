Photography Site for Hannah Winsted

Goal is to create a site for customers to view portfolio, pricing, and contact info.

Version 2.0
Complete overhaul of site layout and design. Customized based on the <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/07/14/freebie-halcyon-days-one-page-website-template/">"Halcon Days"</a> free template (<a href="http://tympanus.net/Freebies/HalcyonDaysTemplate/">Demo Site</a>)

Version 1.0
First completed iteration of the site. Consists of home, archive (photo gallery), pricing, and contact pages. 

Version 0.7
All pages are live, including archive galleries and contact page. Need to finalize pricing, add social media links to contact page, optimize for mobile, and condense & clean code.

Version 0.5
Completely functional site without all images files uploaded/organized. Contact form is functional, navigation working properly. May still contain minor bugs, CSS files need cleaned and ideally merged, waiting on final images from Hannah for slideshow/archives.
