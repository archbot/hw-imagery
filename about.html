  <h2>Hannah Winsted</h2>
	<p>Hey guys, my name is Hannah. I'm a 20 year old mother of 3.. furbabies. They're spoiled rotten and get photographed so often I'm sure you'll be able to pick them out of a lineup in no time. My other half is my high-school sweetheart, Travis. (T-dog, T-rizzle, Trav, Traviekins) He is the one who keeps me grounded and my ego intact LOL. I'm new to this whole photography thing, so I'm learning with you as we go. Non-formal, lifestyle shots are my favorite. Getting the kiddos out in a field at sunset and letting them enjoy themselves makes my heart happy, and catching the smiles on camera makes me even happier. I'm open to shooting any style of photos as long as it makes you happy in the end. Feel free to message me if you have any questions about anything, whether you're interested in a session with me or not, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!</p>
